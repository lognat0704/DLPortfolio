### Summary

Hi, I am Nelson Hong Ming Tseng, a designer and also a data scientist. I feel the great potential when I burst out laughing at the wired animal images from GAN. Believing the capacity to generate unique images from GAN leads me to be a data scientist. Welcome to check out the following projects to understand me more. Welcome to email (hmtseng0704@gmail.com) me if you have further questions
