### Project Description
Delivering precisely a description of a visual design style is always a challenging task for clients. This model selects visual design style pictures based on text descriptions of style. Itâ€™s a great tool to facilitate the communication of design style between clients and designers

### Responsibility
- Participate in the label system of design style, collect and clean visual data

- Develop, build, and improve Deep Residual Networks and Convolutional Neural Network for design style image classification. The prototype only achieved 70% accuracy. By implementation of Transfer Learning and Stochastic Gradient Descent skills, the model finally reach accuracy 90% in six classes with 3000 images
