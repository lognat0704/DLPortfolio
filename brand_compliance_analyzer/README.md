# Brand Compliance Analyzer

### Project Description

Delivering precisely a description of a visual design style is always a challenging task for clients. This model selects visual design style pictures based on text descriptions of style. Itâ€™s a great tool to facilitate the communication of design style between clients and designers

### Responsibility

-Build Product Architect, map out state machine diagram and arrange the priority of development based on client's needs

-Develop custom color, size, and similarity detections functions using OpenCV, structural similarity index(SSIM), and Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT)

-Understand the math in the algorithms, find the combination of parameters to reach local optima using Grid Search, achieving recall 95% in 1000 images

-Develop, build, and improve Deep Residual Networks and Convolutional Neural Network for the same logo but different editions' classification. The model finally reaches the accuracy of 90% in four classes with only 800 images
